### Specs in more detail
  
- One of the perks of Node over other cryptocurrency mining hardware is that it fits right in the palm of your hand. Node measures just 3.5’’ x 4.9’’ x 6.9’’ (L x W x H) and weighs just 2 lbs. It’s easily portable and fits seamlessly into any room.

- The processor (also known as a central processing unit or CPU), has a huge effect on the overall performance of Node. A fast processor gives Node more speed when operating. The processor of Node is the Celeron J3455, a quad-core 64-bit x86 desktop microprocessor introduced by Intel in 2016. It is based on Goldmont microarchitecture and is manufactured on a 14 nm process. The chip operates at 1.5 GHz with burst frequency of 2.3 GHz and has a TDP of 10 W. This MPU incorporates Intel’s HD Graphics 500 GPU operating at 250 MHz with a burst frequency of 750 MHz.

- RAM indicates how fast or slow Node will be able to operate. For the device working to power the Incognito privacy network, 4 GB of RAM is used. The RAM device’s name is Crucial 4GB DDR3L-1600/1866 SODIMM. Also, Node has 512 gigabytes of storage. The capacity fits kind of storage-heavy work like powering privacy crypto network.

- Node can communicate well with wireless network adapter in Intel dual-band wireless-ac 3168 model and with local-area network adapter in 1x Realtek RTL8168/8111 Gigabit LAN.

- The input voltage for a Node to properly operate is 100-240 AC. The 65W Power Supply keeps it charged.

- The operating system is Ubuntu 18.04

- The ideal temperature for Node is between -20 Celsius degrees to +60 Celsius degrees. Node operates well in a range of typical indoor conditions.

- Node is backed by a 1-year warranty . If you believe it is a manufacturer’s defect, just send your Node to us. We’ll verify the problem, fix it, and send your Node back to you so you can keep powering the network & earning.

- When you open the box, you’ll see your Node, the power cord, international power plug adapters, an instruction manual, and a thank you note from us. Watch Chris from our team unbox the Node here .
